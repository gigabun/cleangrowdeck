    <h1>Cleaning Your Grow Deck </h1> 
    <p> There are times when you will notice your pods are not getting enough moisture even when your bowl is filled to the "fill to here" line. This is something that may happen after you have gone through a successful grow cycle. Gardens that have a pump will come with a 2 piece grow deck which waters your pods from the top. The track that distributes the water tends to gather nutrient build up and roots. Naturally, if there are blockages in your track, your pods are not going to get watered from the top. 
<p>This article applies only to garden that have pumps. If you are unsure click here. (add hyperlink)</p>

  <h2>How the Deck Waters your pods</h2> 
  <p>If you run your pump without your lid on, you will notice the water will flow out of the center spout. The water pressure will push the water into the grow deck where it will be distributed through the track and into your pods.

  <h2>How to Clean Your Deck</h2>
  <h3>Before Starting</h3>
  <p>Keep in mind that cleaning your deck can be messy. Find a surface that you don't mind getting water on and that is easy to clean. We recommend working near a sink or outside.<p>
<p>This is a process that should only be done when there are no pods inserted in your garden. If your pods can be easily removed, place them in a container of your choice or in your sink to prevent contamination.<br><br>If there are pods in your garden with mature plants and complicated root systems, proceed with caution. Some people do trim the roots of their mature plants BUT there is a high risk of over trimming and killing the plant. Because of this risk, it is not recommended.</p>
  <h3>Step 1</h3>
  <p> Remove your deck from your garden. You will want to be looking at the bottom of the deck (the side that faces the water).</p>
  <h3>Step 2</h2>
  <p> You will notice there are tabs along the perimeter of your deck. Push all of the tabs towards the center until the deck is completely loose.</p>
  <p>This may not be as easy if you have a larger garden, like a Bounty. Please exercise caution with your self and your garden when trying to press the tabs in.
  <h3>Step 3</h3> 
  <p>Turn the deck over and remove the inner piece and inspect the bottom. At this point you may notice the nutrient and root build up along the water track. Remove all of the roots and rinse your deck until all build up is removed. You can use vinegar to clean the deck if rinsing is not enough.</p>
  <p> **If you choose to use vinegar make sure to rinse thoroughly and completely dry before placing the deck back on your garden.<p> 
  <h3>Step 4</h3>
  <p>Once your deck is clean, put your deck back together and secure your back onto your garden. Initiate a pump test and make sure all of your pod spaces have water running through them. 
  <h3>Step 5</h3> 
  <p>Place your pods back into your garden and watch the, grow!</p>
